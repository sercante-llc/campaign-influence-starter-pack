> This sample application is designed to run on Salesforce Platform. 

> This package is designed to both run independently (in a self contained scratch org) as well as be directly deployed to an existing org (Sandbox or Production).

> Users who wish to view the Dashboards and Reports will need to have the **Campaign Influence** Permission.

## Installing the Starter Pack using a Scratch Org
This installation option is most likely to be used by developers and advanced Administrators.

1. Set up your environment. The steps include:

    - Enable Dev Hub in your org
    - [Install Salesforce CLI](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_setup.meta/sfdx_setup/sfdx_setup_install_cli.htm)

1. If you haven't already done so, authorize your hub org and provide it with an alias (**myhuborg** in the command below):

    ```
    sfdx force:auth:web:login -d -a myhuborg
    ```

1. If you know about and use `git`, clone this repository

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/sercante-llc/campaign-influence-starter-pack

    ```

1. In App Launcher, select **Dashboards** and open the **Campaign Influence** dashboard.

## Note on Sample Data Import

We use the sfdx bulk upsert capabilities, which require our objects to have an external ID to facilitate the import. The custom fields in this package are ONLY to support the demo data and are NOT required to be deployed in any of your own orgs.

## Optional Installation Instructions

This repository contains several additional files to facilitate the deployment and setup of scratch orgs with demo data. If you wish to use these and deploy any of them to your sandbox or dev org, edit the package.xml file to include whatever you like.
